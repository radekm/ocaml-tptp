When reading this file set base-dir to 'basic/base-dir'.

Content of 'basic/base-dir/dir/a.tptp':

  fof(d, axiom, d).

Content of 'basic/base-dir/dir/c.tptp':

  fof(c, axiom, c).

Content of 'basic/dir/a.tptp':

  include('b.tptp', [a]).
  fof(a, lemma, a).
  fof(b, lemma, b).
  fof(c, lemma, c).

Content of 'basic/dir/b.tptp':

  cnf(a, axiom, a).
  cnf(b, axiom, b).
  cnf(b, axiom, ~b).

Content of 'basic/a.tptp':

  % In 'basic/a.tptp'
  include('dir/a.tptp', [a, b, a]).
  include('dir/c.tptp').

What is tested:

- Only formulas are included.

  - The comment from 'basic/a.tptp' is not included.

- An include without a formula selection includes all formulas from the file.

- An include with a formula selection includes only the selected formulas.

  - The formula selection [a, b, a] includes 2 formulas with the name a
    and 1 formula with the name b.

- Included files with a relative path are searched in the directory
  of the file they're included from, or if not found there then in base-dir.

  - The included file 'dir/a.tptp' is resolved to 'basic/dir/a.tptp'
    and not to 'basic/base-dir/dir/a.tptp'.
  - The included file 'dir/c.tptp' is resolved to 'basic/base-dir/dir/c.tptp'
    since the file 'basic/dir/c.tptp' doesn't exist.

- Included files can themselves contain includes.
