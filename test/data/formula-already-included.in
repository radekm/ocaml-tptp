/*

Content of 'formula-already-included/a.tptp':

  cnf(a, axiom, a).
  cnf(a, axiom, ~a).

What is tested:

- If a formula selection contains n occurences of some name then
  the included file must contain exactly n formulas with that name.

  - An exception is raised since the formula selection contains 1 occurence
    of the name a but the included file contains 2 formulas with the name a.
