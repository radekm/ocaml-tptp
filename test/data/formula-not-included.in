/*

The file 'formula-not-included/a.tptp' is empty.

What is tested:

- If a formula selection contains n occurences of some name then
  the included file must contain exactly n formulas with that name.

  - An exception is raised since the formula selection contains 1 occurence
    of the name b but the included file contains no formulas with the name b.
